# Hello MCP

This project is a simple "Hello, World!" example demonstrating the basic functionality of the `FastMCP` framework. It showcases how to set up a server that exposes a JSON-RPC interface over HTTP and a client that communicates with it.

## Features

*   A basic `FastMCP` server instance.
*   Stateless HTTP communication.
*   An example of a streaming JSON-RPC response.
*   A Python client using `requests` to interact with the server's `tools/list` method.
